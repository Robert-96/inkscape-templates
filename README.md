# inkscape-templates

A collection of templates for Inkscape.

## Create a new template

> **Note**: This method works only if you’re using Inkscape version 1.0 or later.

Open one of the templates from [./templates](./templates) or create a new document that you want to use as a template.

Add the templates to your library by going to **File ‣ Save Template**, and from there you can choose a name and some other metadata, and the document you’re currently working on in Inkscape will be saved to that library as a template.

## Add multiple templates  

Copy the `.svg` files in the folder indicated at **Edit ‣ Preferences ‣ System: User templates**.

Restart Inkscape to see the new templates in the list.
